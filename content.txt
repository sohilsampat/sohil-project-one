Sohil Sampat: Background

I believe I have quite an interesting background especially when talking about
where I’m from. I always have a tough time answer the question, “Where are you
from?” The reason being, I was born in India where I spent maybe the first two
years of my life, then moved and grew up in Thailand. I stayed there for a good
15 years, as my father got a job there. However, in spite of being there so
long, I was not considered a citizen due to visa conflicts. I attended one
school for 13 years, Ekamai International School. It was where I went for
elementary, middle, and high school. The curriculum was american-based and so I
had a good exposure to learning English and how the education system worked.
Thirteen years in the same school gifted me with some life long friends whom I
still keep in touch with, though I’m on the other side of the world now. It was
absolutely amazing growing up in such a beautiful country filled with really
humble people. I’m quite certain it’s because of how others were, that I’ve
grown to be who I am today, somewhat humble. After having spent so much time in
Bangkok, it was time for graduation and I had to make the decision of whether to
stay and continue my education or to leave to another country. The decision was
nerve-wracking! Leaving parents, not having a constant money supply, living on
my own in a new country, and dealing with so many new things was a scary
thought. Nonetheless, I’m glad I made the right decision and decided to pursue a
mechanical engineering degree in the States.
